# Configuration files

Configuration files for applications supporting scripted configuration.

## Install

The install script will source the `zshrc` file by adding a line to the
`~/.zshrc` file.

```bash
./install.sh
```

## tmux

`TPM` and all over plugins should install automatically. Run `CTRL-B + I` if an
installation fails.


## Rebuilding Nix

The system can be rebuilt using [nh](https://github.com/nix-community/nh).

Run `nh` for available options.
